# Ideas of things to complete

- Have an empty state for the views with a welcome message or information on how to get started.
- Add client-side validation to forms fields. For example not amount below 0.
- Remove some of the business logic from the views.
- Show server errors in toastr
- Push data into data set when adding a new transaction
- Update data into data set when updating a transaction
- Improve the unit tests added
- Create an error service to catch all api errors. Add a catchError pipe to the api request in the transaction service. That way it can all be managed from one service
- Have a skeleton state
- Add animations when switching between views and loaders for when data is being processed.
